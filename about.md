I'm a .NET developer, husband and father (but not necessarily in that order). I like starting lots of projects just to determine if I what I'm thinking is possible. I'm not the best at finishing them; I figure that's because once I've determined that something can be done the project becomes boring and I move on to something else.

This blog is intended to be a place for me to share things I learn from projects I start, or my thoughts how to improve productivity within development teams.
