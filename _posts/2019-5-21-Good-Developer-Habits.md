## Habits

Habits are the things we do without thinking about them. Habits allow us to
react quickly. They allow us to be productive tasks while freeing our minds to
think about something else. Habits often form by coincidence, but they can be
created too and that's what I want to talk about here. How can we as developers
form good habits that will make us better at what we do? Can we estimate
difficult tasks quickly? Can habits help us respond to changing requirements
more accurately and maintain _clean_ code?

I'm going to be honest. I don't know. But I want to explore what encouraging
good habits on a development team looks like. For that I will need to start
with a list of good habits to encourage, and a list of bad habits to try and
change.

This post will get updated as I think of more habits.
