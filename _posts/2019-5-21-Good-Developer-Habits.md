## Habits

Habits are the things we do without thinking about them. Habits allow us to
react quickly. They allow us to be productive tasks while freeing our minds to
think about something else. Habits often form by coincidence, but they can be
created too and that's what I want to talk about here. How can we as developers
form good habits that will make us better at what we do? Can we estimate
difficult tasks quickly? Can habits help us respond to changing requirements
more accurately and maintain _clean_ code?

I'm going to be honest. I don't know. But I want to explore what encouraging
good habits on a development team looks like. For that I will need to start
with a list of good habits to encourage, and a list of bad habits to try and
change.

This post will get updated as I think of more habits.

### Good Habits

#### Switch Hats

1. Cue: While working on feature, discover a refactoring that needs to occur.
2. Routine: Stop working on feature and actively refactor section of code.
3. Reward: Continue working with clean code.

#### Don't guess. Measure

1. Cue: A Bug is discovered.
2. Routine: Write unit test to expose the issue. Correct issue. Submit PR
3. Reward: Feeling productive

#### Focused time

1. Cue: Recognize body of work to complete
2. Routine: Turn off email, IM, and phone. Work on tasks for an hour or two.
3. Reward: Feeling productive

### Bad Habits

#### Guess and propose solution

1. Cue: A bug is discovered.
2. Routine: Assume you know what the issue is. Make change to code and submit PR
without running solution.
3. Reward: Feeling productive

#### Blame design for not understanding program

1. Cue: Feeling lost in code. Unable to navigate code. Unable to make changes
reliably.
2. Routine: Restructure program without consulting team. Ignore unit tests
because they tested the _old_ program structure. Continue restructure
through entire code base.
3. Reward: Feeling productive

#### Check email constantly

1. Cue: Email notification
2. Routine: Stop what you are working on and respond to email right away.
3. Reward: Feeling productive

#### Interrupt co-worker needlessly

1. Cue: Feeling bored at work
2. Routine: IM friend
3. Reward: Feeling connected
