# Interruptions

## How can I continue to do work *and* allow myself to be interruptable?

Currently I am the *Dev Lead* on my project. In my current role it is expected first that I am available to my development team.
This is the important to me because I love sharing knowledge. I like explaining various technologies or software patterns
to developers. I feel it helps them gain tools they need to solve their own problems in the future. I learned most of what I know
from team leads and other developers and I genuinely value that type of collaboration.

I am also responsible for the more complex tasks on the project. This obviously makes sense. As dev lead I should be
technically strong and be one of the best problem solvers on the project. Complex problems require long periods of uninterrupted
time and often that can be difficult to find.

## Unplanned Time

Often on projects there are chunks of unplanned time built into a sprint. Say for instance with the number of developers
on a team we expect everyone to be able to do 200 hours of work. So during planning we will plan for 160 hours of work
and leave the rest for the *unplanned* tasks that come up. Most of that unplanned work comes through the development
lead first through a meeting or IM. In a way it is the development leads responsibility to identify unplanned work
and delegate it to the rest of the team.

## Training

If any new members are joining the team, they will look to the development lead for guidance. Hopefully the lead has prepared
some documentation of how to get started on the project that makes onboarding easier. As a consultant it is common for
developers to come and go from a project throughout the lifetime of the engagement.

## Other Responsibilities

I'm sure there are other responsibilities I am leaving out, but the main point is, there are several things
a development lead is responsible for that do not include solving complex problems. The question is, how can
anyone solve a large problem while also being available to the team for questions? I don't think anyone can.
The solution I think lies in communication. If there is a large problem to solve, and the team is too busy
or does not feel technically capable then it needs to be communicated that I will be working on that issue for
the next several hours. If the team does feel that they can handle the issue, then it needs to be delegated.
The first responsibility is to be available.
