## Can you over communicate?
I think if you're not getting responses then your communications are just noise
This is rare however, so most likely **no** you can't over communicate.

## Who should development leads be communicating to?
Concerns from the development team need to be brought up to the project manager.
Concerns from the project manager need to be brought back to the development team.
Therefore a good development lead should be communicating to everyone.

## How should a development lead communicate?
Documentation for the development team.
Documentation for anyone who is going to use the product.
Documentation for the product owner and project manager.
Meetings with the development team.
Meetings with the architects.
Meetings with operations.
Meetings with product owner and project manager.
Be available to answer questions over **instant** message.

## Everyone needs to feel *heard*
Within a team everyone has an interest in the project. Everyone wants it to go well
and has their own past experiences to bring into the conversation. It is important
to build concensus among the group and allow everyone to voice an opinion. If the team
has decided that one process isn't working and something needs to change, the development
lead needs to facilitate that change.

## Strategy to communicate, communicate, communicate
Assuming you use outlook, create reoccuring tasks with reminders of things that need
to happen each day. Each day create a reminder to email each member of the team to
check in? Look at the next task that should be worked on and ask if they need anything
or ran into any issues. The responses can then be aggregated up to the project manager
the next morning. Again use a reoccuring task with a reminder to help build this habbit.
Leading a development team is really all about communication. When *tasks* are assigned,
they should be delegated to another member so that you can stay available.
