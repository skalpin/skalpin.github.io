# Consulting vs. Enterprise Software

Consulting is great when you're on a project. When you're not however it can be a little
unnerving. Without knowing what you'll be working on next, you can't really ramp up or
pick up a specific technology to learn that will help you on your next project. In this same sense
consulting is great because you always get put on new projects and you always get to learn the
latest and greatest technologies. (most of the time) Sometimes you get a maintainence contract
that requires you to work with some legacy system to update / upgrade it.

The alternative obviously is to work at a company that writes some large scale enterprise software
that most of the people who work at the company use. Working on enterprise software can be great
for development processes, but you generally get caught working with older technology because
upgrading everyone in the company comes with costs.

I've decided to go with consulting. I will get to keep my skills relavant, and I get to work
with new clients and new projects frequently. I have however decided to move to a larger consulting
company that works on larger projects than my previous one. I find that this move will keep
me up to date on the latest development processes. Developers played all of the roles at my previous
company and we spent a lot of time building technical debt and not implementing the best overall
solution to the problem.
